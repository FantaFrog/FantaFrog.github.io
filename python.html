<h2>Written Response</h2>
<p>
BIG BAGS OF BUNEY is a a text based aventure game designed and coded by Christopher Thorpe & Kyle Lee. As one of the creators, I would like to share some insight into our process. A funny story that came from project is about 3 days into the project, Kyle and myself are coding a function and trying to change states. For some reason, it wouldn't change states and we spent 40 minutes trying to fgure out what the problem is. Come to find out that the only thing wrong, was that the word "proceed" was misspelled and was the only problem with all of the code. In addition to misspelling, Figuring out how to end the game and program completely was a challenge. I had to do some research on the internet on how to use the inding out how to import sys to use the sys.exit(0) command to end the while loop that we used to run our states.</li>
